# WSL_Bern_fire_susceptibility
The script relates to a methodological report on canton Bern (Switzerland) forest ignition danger. 
It gathers the following main steps and results:
- Variable selection
- Response curves
- Fire ignition modelling (SDM approach)
- Variable importance
- Management options to mitigate fire danger
  - General guideline per habitat types (GLMM approach)
  - Variable priorization for management â†’ context specific guidelines (XGB + Shapley values)

The data to run the script is available on this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YRootguDS7Kbb3rgLsVNUkI828AW1Q5n?usp=sharing). Most output data are already saved inside the output folder if you don't want to rerun the whole script. Those folders should be put in the same folder as the script in order not to break the script paths.

This work was performed in the [Dynamic Macroecology group](https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organisation/research-units/land-change-science/translate-to-englisch-dynamische-makrooekologie/) of [WSL](https://www.wsl.ch/en/) (Switzerland).
